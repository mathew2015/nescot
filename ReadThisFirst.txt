Hello people of Earth, (or more Specifically 'Bravo Team').

This is our github repository,
We have the task of developing a new electronic learning system for our Web Application Development module.
I'd like to think that you all wish to get the most from this module,
there's much work to complete and we need to work as a team.

This repository is a special type of 'folder'; just like your computer's folders, except here you can:
add, remove, edit and save your work as a group.

We can do the following things:

- Work Collaboratively
- Add/Modify the same files to gradually improve on the web application
- Share ideas and collectively implement the best ideas
- Download and test the same updated/complete website (same version)
- Quickly access our project via this simple URL: https://github.com/josh1600/nescot/
- Easily deploy the completed application once all the editions have been made
- Gain recognition for the hard work you contribute
- Save time managing files (as they will remain here (unless testing))

I look forward to this project and hope that you will all learn something and be encouraged to work as a team to get this done.
Please make an account and email me or tell me your details in-person so that I can add you to the trusted members of this repository.
When adding a 'commit' to any of the exisiting files, please MAKE SURE you write a lengthy comment describing the following:
- What it does
- Why you added it
- Any concerns you have with it
- References to line numbers or function names (include appropriate element identification)


Lastly, If you have any concerns or general questions regarding this task,
please contact me directly via email or join the discussion on skype:

Remember, We will crush team Alpha if we put some effort into this!
Thanks for reading.
